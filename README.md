Punto de fuga (Vanishing Point) was the project I worked on for my video game development diploma in Univesidad Tecnológica Nacional (National Technological University).

It consists of a third-person escape room developed over a month of very intense, almost feverish work, enormously challenging but even more enriching.

It is not and does not pretend to be a display a good game design, it’s script is improvised, the sound rough and the code is not always as elegant as it should be. But hey, It works!

For me it has a very ambitious project. There were tons of things I had no idea how to get them done, so it meant a lot of investigation, trial and error. Overtime it got me in a mood where I wanted to experiment with different ways to do things, even if it meant not having a very consistent code. Of course, there where things that I got done, but in ways that are very ugly.

Someday I would like to gather courage, take it back to zero and turn it into a multiple narratives game -in the spirit of The Stanley Parable (Davey Wreden, 2011)- that revolves around the themes of confinement, loneliness and being in a state of loop.
